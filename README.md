# MyBot – Easy Install (Ubuntu 22+)

This repo wraps your bot with a one-command installer and a systemd service.

## What’s inside
- `src/` – your uploaded bot code
- `install.sh` – curl-able installer that clones the repo and sets up a service
- `run.sh` – language-aware runner (Python/Node/PHP)
- `.env.example` – copy to `.env` and fill secrets
- `scripts/systemd/mybot.service` – generated by installer

Detected language: **php** (Detected composer.json / PHP files).
Detected entrypoint: **bot.php**

## Quick install (on server)
Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USER` and repo name after you push:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/mybot-easy-install/main/install.sh)
```

You can also set variables inline:
```bash
APP_NAME=mycoolbot REPO_URL=https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/mybot-easy-install bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/mybot-easy-install/main/install.sh)
```

After install:
```bash
sudo nano /opt/$APP_NAME/.env   # put your tokens/keys
sudo systemctl start $APP_NAME
sudo systemctl status $APP_NAME
sudo journalctl -u $APP_NAME -f
```

## Development
- Edit `run.sh` if your entrypoint differs.
- For Python, `requirements.txt` in `src/` is auto-installed.
- For Node, `npm install && npm start` is used if `package.json` exists.
